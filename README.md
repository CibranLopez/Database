# Database

A complete record of all scripts devoted to obtaining the descriptors of the database and analyzing the resulting set of characteristics is here presented.

The main program to add new compounds is 'Incorporate_data.ipynb'. The numerated ones are the programs which remain to be included in the former.

As a new simulation is passed, the program automatically generates the folders in the main Database and computes all the defined descriptors.
